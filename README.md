# To-dos project

![Web app main page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115510880/230681256-b28bb707-c729-4363-9179-9a411e5f81de.png)
This is a web application that was developed with React.js. It is the first
challenge of the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) React course. All
the images and design were provided by them.

Working on this project allowed me to put into practice the core concepts of the
library and how to integrate it with Typescript.

## About the project

![Creating to-dos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115510880/230681326-71e6e6db-eccc-4451-8f98-15659d1f0b82.png)
This web app allows users to create and delete to-dos. Additionally, it is
possible to mark a to-do as completed. So the user can keep track of the number
of to-dos that have been created and the number that have been completed. It is
worth to mention that the app is responsive, working in the majority of devices.
